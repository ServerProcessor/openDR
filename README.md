OIO (or **"OWL"**, because OIO looks like one) is an ultra low-cost, open hardware device to image the retina (also called imaging the [fundus of the eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye))). Having the ability to image the retina easily and with low cost is invaluable in the early detection of potentially vision-threatening diseases, such as [diabetic retinopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy).
