OIO (or **"OWL"**, because OIO looks like one) is an ultra low-cost, open hardware device to image the retina (also called imaging the [fundus of the eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye))). Having the ability to image the retina easily and with low cost is invaluable in the early detection of potentially vision-threatening diseases, such as [diabetic retinopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy).

## Software Versions used
* OpenCV (cv2) 2.4.9.1
* Python 2.7.11+
* GCC 5.3.2

## Hardware platform
Details about assembly and parts is given on our [hackaday page](https://hackaday.io/project/11943-open-indirect-ophthalmoscope). Our software is designed and tested on a raspberry PI v2B and 3B, with M12 mount rPI cameras (through DSI cable). The OS on the raspberry PI we use is [Wheezy](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/2013-07-26-wheezy-raspbian/).

## Dependencies
All dependencies can be installed by running `install.sh`, sudo password would be required if some dependencies are not present. We recommend installing the software on a fresh dedicated rPI.

## Deploying the application
The repository must be cloned into the 'home' folder of Raspberry Pi, i.e., `/home/pi/` or just the `~` path, all environment variables are set with respect to this!
The name of the user should be **pi** (which is the default on new rPI OS installations).


## Under the hood

The GUI is run as a fullscreen webapp served with Flask. Our system's backbone is Python.
The folder structure is as follows (All individual folders have their own readme):

####Folder Structure
openDR  
   |---experimental_modules  
   |---images  
   |---static  
   |---templates  


`experimental_modules` contains work in progress python modules. 

`images` contains the images taken using the device. Images are stored in a folder named with the MR Number, and image names are of the format `MR_no_i_j.jpg` where i and j are integers. _i_ indicates session no and _j_ indicates pic number within that session.

`static` contains all static elements (css, fonts, images, javascript) for the webapp gui which is served.

`templates` contains all html for the webapp

#### Important Files
`fundus_mod3.py` has the main functionality, and integrates the GUI and imaging. This code polls for a button press and captures two images in quick succession (illuminating by two separate LEDs controlled by GPIO). The images are processed and then saved.

`name` stores the image number of the image last clicked and stores on the device (temporary hack!)

`Fundus_cam.py` stores the class which allows for the creation of object controlling the Picamera. 

`simplehttp.sh` creates a python simplehttp server on port 8000 to allow for transfer of files from the device.
