OIO (or **"OWL"**, because OIO looks like one) is an ultra low-cost, open hardware device to image the retina (also called imaging the [fundus of the eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye))). Having the ability to image the retina easily and with low cost is invaluable in the early detection of potentially vision-threatening diseases, such as [diabetic retinopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy).

## Software Versions used
* OpenCV (cv2) 2.4.9.1
* Python 2.7.11+
* GCC 5.3.2

## Hardware platform
Details about assembly and parts is given on our [hackaday page](https://hackaday.io/project/11943-open-indirect-ophthalmoscope). Our software is designed and tested on a raspberry PI v2B and 3B, with M12 mount rPI cameras (through DSI cable).
The latest Raspberry Pi used was RPi 3 Mod B.
It runs a custom Raspbian Wheezy provided by Waveshare which allows their LCD touchscreen (Waveshare 5inch HDMI LCD (B)) drivers to run on it.
